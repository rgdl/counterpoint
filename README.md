# Fux's Counterpoint
This module implements the counterpoint rules of Johann Joseph Fux's "Gradus Ad Parnassum".

Goals:
- To represent counterpoint arrangements in a MIDI-compatible format
- To determine whether an arrangement breaks any rules and if so, which ones and where
- To algorithically generate counterpoint or harmonies more generally 

ðŸš§ Still a bit of a construction site! ðŸš§

Trying this coding approach:
 - Write a fairly ambitious integration test
 - Rapidly write the required code [CURRENT STEP!]
 - Get that code working with the aid of unit tests at each of the points where it doesn't work straight up.
