# Fux's Counterpoint
This module implements the counterpoint rules of Johann Joseph Fux's "Gradus Ad Parnassum".

Goals:
- To represent counterpoint arrangements in a MIDI-compatible format
- To determine whether an arrangement breaks any rules and if so, which ones and where
- To algorithically generate counterpoint or harmonies more generally 

ðŸš§ Still a bit of a construction site! ðŸš§
